                    The Norton Motorcycle Company (formerly Norton Motors, Ltd.) is a British motorcycle marque,
                    originally from Birmingham, UK. It was founded in 1898 as a manufacturer of "fittings and
                    parts for the two-wheel trade".

                    By 1902, the company began manufacturing motorcycles
                    with bought-in engines. In 1908, a Norton-built engine was added to the range. This began a
                    long series of production of single and eventually twin-cylinder motorcycles,
                    and a long history of racing involvement.
